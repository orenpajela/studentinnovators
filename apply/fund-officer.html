Our organization values connection, collaboration, and community, and we believe that our strength comes from the belief that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br><br>Student Innovators has a mission to be the student organization with the biggest positive impact at UTD. We are a hybrid organization- both a 501c3 non-profit and a UTD recognized student organization, and we grow and develop our members to become change-makers in their campus, communities, and companies by offering one-of-a-kind experiences that will revolutionize their career trajectory.</p>
